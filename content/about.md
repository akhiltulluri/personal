title: About
---

Hello world! I'm _Akhil_, a sofware developer from India - currently in the United States pursuing my masters in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston.

My interests are broadly in _Computer Systems (distributed systems, storage systems, operating systems)_ and _Programming languages (compilers, formal methods)_.

Outside of tech, I care about _philosophy, politics, and poetry_. I used to play video games. I'm quoting the following from [Kailash Nadh's website](https://nadh.in) because it captures my worldview perfectly:

> I have a bleak view of the future thanks to human-made climate change, humanity's callous penchant for relentless extraction, environmental and ecological destruction, and its irrational hatred for fellow beings. And yet, somehow, I am not a dysfunctional pessimist.

This website is meant to be my personal space, and not strictly professional. Feel free to contact me on my socials if you're similar interests, or have something to say on any of my [thoughts](/thoughts).
